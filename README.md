## Overview ##
<h4>What and How?</h4><br>
<!--- Derek's Section --->
So what exactly is a Midi-Keyboard and why did we choose it? Well a Midi-Keyboard is a keyboard thaat you can hook up to your computer
and use it with different music creation software to produce all sorts of cool results! Our goal is to have the program read sheet music
from a library and have the key that reperesents the note being played light up from an LED underneath it! In order to do this we need a few non traditional things such as an Arduino Unit, Serial-to-midi conversion software, LED's, and a keyboard to test it all with. The way it works is it uses a midi-input instead of serial input along with an Arduino made by Patrick Driscoll. The goal is to have the library read music into the program and the program will dictate which keys from there represent what and will light up accordingly.

<h4>Why?</h4><br>
We chose this project after discussing about things we were passionate about. This turns out to be something that Patrick is very passionate about and takes his personal time outside of school and work to learn about.<br>

      and explain what you hope to learn--->

Here is a similar idea of what it looks like in the real world<br>

<h3>What Approaches from class will we bring?</h3><br>
<br>
<h5>Data Abstraction</h5> - The goal would to create some objects that represent the keyboard and the notes. From there each key needs to be assigned and we can do that using object orientation and assignment.<br>
<br>
<h5>Recursion</h5> - I beleive we could incorperate this by making a function that recursively assigns the notes to keys at the start of the
program provided we order the keys / notes the way we want. If this is too far out then I still think we could atleast make a light
show from recursion.<br>
<br>
<h5>Map / Filter / Reduce</h5> - At this current point in implementation I have a plan to possibly have a container for notes left to go in
a song and it could be filtered out for things that are played which could be placed in another list for comparison. Its kind of a far
stretch but if there's time and its possible this is one form of an idea. <br>
<br>
<h5>Object-Orientation</h5> - Kind of building back on to the data abstraction the goal is to create objects for the keyboard and notes. In order to assign them we need objects and in order to be abstract we need objects to assign this too.<br>
<br>
<h5>Functional Approaches</h5> - I would like to see possibly a few functions that can map the keys once we get set up and possibly may even be
able to play a song using like a recursive call going down a list of planned notes! <br>
<br>
<h5>State-Modification Approaches</h5> - As of right now the objects will be changing often depending on what note they encapsulate. So long answer is yes, short answer is theres a good possibility.<br>
<br>
<h5>Expression Evaluator</h5> - As of right now I don't see this or map/filter/reduce really fitting into the project. I dont want to bite off more then we can chew yet but I can see us making something to evaluate notes for a template song that someone can learn piano by following - which is what Patricks passion / goal was in the first place. <br>
<br>
<h5>Lazy Evaluation</h5> - At this current time we have not learned about it so I can't say for sure but as the project goes on and I learn more about what the concept is , it is completely up in the air for using it.<br>

<!--- Try to make a diagram and show what peices really go into this. I tried to give a rough explanation in paragraph one but im no where near as educated or intelligent about this area as you are! --->

include arrows showing flow of information
internal components annotated with Racket libraries that they will use
